# Manifest Basics

Flo discovers tools and skills by file name:

- `**/*.tool.yaml` defines one tool
- `**/*.skill.yaml` defines one skill
- `**/*.schedule.yaml` defines one bundle-managed schedule
- `**/*.prompts.yaml` defines one bundle-managed runtime prompt manifest

`SKILL.md` discovery is not supported.

## Tool Manifest Shape

Every tool manifest must include:

- `name`
- `description`
- `input_schema`
- `execution`

Optional fields include:

- `timeout_ms`
- `retry_policy`
- `vault`
- `state`
- `requires_permissions`
- `direct_call`
- `script_tools`

Example:

```yaml
name: capture_example
description: Open a page and return the current URL.
input_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    url:
      type: string
  required: [url]
  additionalProperties: false
execution:
  type: script
  script_file: scripts/capture_example.mts
  entrypoint: run
timeout_ms: 30000
```

Tool field behavior:

- supported `agentd` slash commands are `/new`, `/call`, and `/web`; bare `/new` starts a fresh task without model stages, while `/new <request>` runs normally in a fresh task

- `direct_call`
  - defaults to `false`
  - when `true`, the tool may be invoked explicitly through `/call <tool_id>`
  - it also makes the tool reachable from `flo.callTool(...)` even when the tool is outside the current selected-skill tool set
  - it does not automatically expose helper tools to the LLM
- `script_tools`
  - defaults to `[]`
  - declares helper tool ids callable from this tool through `flo.callTool(...)`
  - these helpers are not automatically exposed to the LLM
  - these helpers are not listed by `/call` unless the helper tool also sets `direct_call: true`
- `requires_permissions`
  - defaults to `[]`
  - declares permission ids required before the tool is usable
  - the caller must have all listed permissions

## Script Execution

For `execution.type = script`, define exactly one of:

- `script`: inline JavaScript or TypeScript
- `script_file`: a relative path under the manifest directory

Use `entrypoint` to select the exported function the runtime should call.

## Skill Manifest Shape

Every skill manifest must include:

- `skill_id`
- `name`
- `description`

Each skill must define exactly one instruction source:

- `instruction`
- `instruction_file`

Optional fields include:

- `version`
- `execution_model_tier`
- `completion_verification`
- `tools`
- `script_tools`
- `tool_definitions`
- `requires_skills`
- `requires_labels`
- `requires_permissions`

Example:

```yaml
skill_id: browser_examples
name: Browser Examples
description: Browser-based tools for authenticated workflows.
execution_model_tier: large
tools:
  - read_text_file
script_tools:
  - send_media_attachment
tool_definitions:
  - name: capture_example
    description: Open a page and return the current URL.
    input_schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        url:
          type: string
      required: [url]
    execution:
      type: script
      script_file: scripts/capture_example.mts
      entrypoint: run
instruction_file: instructions.md
```

Field behavior:

- `tools`
  - declares referenced external or built-in tool ids for the selected skill
  - these tools are exposed to the LLM tool list
  - these tools are also callable from `flo.callTool(...)`
- `execution_model_tier`
  - optionally requests the execution-stage model tier for that skill
  - allowed values: `nano`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `frontier`
  - applies only to the main execution stage, not task selection, gate, or task summary
  - when multiple selected skills request different tiers, Flo uses the highest requested tier
  - the requested tier is resolved through the runtime's configured tier-to-model mapping
  - when omitted, Flo uses the configured execution-stage model
- `script_tools`
  - declares referenced external or built-in tool ids for the selected skill
  - these tools are callable from `flo.callTool(...)`
  - these tools are not exposed to the LLM tool list
- `tool_definitions`
  - declares inline tool manifests owned by the skill
  - inline tools are available to the selected skill without being repeated in `tools` or `script_tools`
- `requires_permissions`
  - defaults to `[]`
  - declares permission ids required before the skill is visible or selectable
  - the caller must have all listed permissions

Authoring rules:

- use `tools` when the model should be able to call the tool directly
- use `script_tools` when only your script should call the tool
- do not repeat an inline tool from `tool_definitions` in either `tools` or `script_tools`
- `script_tools` only changes LLM visibility; it does not create a separate security boundary from the selected skill's scripts

## MCP Tool References

Runtime MCP tools use the same `tools` and `script_tools` fields as built-in and manifest-backed
tools. Their ids have the form `mcp__<server_id>__<tool_name>`:

```yaml
tools:
  - mcp__github__search_issues
script_tools:
  - mcp__github__get_issue
```

The runtime administrator must register the named MCP server separately. Skill manifests contain
only tool ids; server addresses and vault credential bindings are not part of a skill bundle.

## Completion Verification

Skills may override the default completion check with an optional boolean:

```yaml
skill_id: example
name: Example
description: Handle a request
instruction: Complete the requested work.
completion_verification: false
```

Set `completion_verification: true` to request verification, `false` to skip it, or omit
the field to inherit the default. If multiple active skills specify overrides, explicit
`true` takes precedence over `false`. Required helper skills participate in the same rule.
The setting applies to normal successful model-backed execution; it does not add verification
to direct tool calls. An enabled verifier that cannot complete causes the turn to fail rather
than report success. Disabling verification does not allow empty interactive replies: the runtime
attempts one continuation from existing tool results, then reports failure if no visible reply or
attachment is produced.


## Visibility Summary

Flo has separate visibility rules for normal execution and explicit `/call` usage.

During normal execution:

- the LLM sees globally available tools plus tools listed in the selected skills' `tools`
- the selected skills' scripts can call globally available tools, tools listed in the selected skills' `tools` and `script_tools`, and any tool whose manifest sets `direct_call: true`
- inline tools from `tool_definitions` are available to the owning skill without being repeated elsewhere

During `/call` execution:

- `/call` lists tools whose manifests set `direct_call: true`
- the external-app direct-call API uses the same `direct_call: true` gate
- running `/call <tool_id>` preserves the current selected-skill context for nested tool access
- the called tool may always call itself
- the called tool may also call globally available tools and tools listed in that tool manifest's own `script_tools`
- helper tools still remain hidden unless they are global, reachable through the selected skill set, or declared in the direct-call tool's own `script_tools`

## Permission Catalogs

Permissions are bundle-scoped. A skill bundle may include at most one `*.permissions.yaml` file.

Use the catalog file to define the permission ids that skills and tools reference from `requires_permissions`.

Example:

```yaml
catalog_id: admin
version: v1
groups:
  - group_id: admin
    name: Admin
    description: Administrative actions
    permissions:
      - permission_id: admin.roles.write
        name: Manage roles
        description: Create, update, and delete roles
      - permission_id: admin.permissions.read
        name: View permission catalog
```

Catalog fields:

- `catalog_id`
  - optional stable identifier for the catalog
- `version`
  - optional catalog version string
- `groups`
  - required list of permission groups
- `groups[].group_id`
  - required unique group id
- `groups[].name`
  - required display name
- `groups[].description`
  - optional description
- `groups[].permissions`
  - list of permissions in the group
- `groups[].permissions[].permission_id`
  - required unique permission id used by `requires_permissions`
- `groups[].permissions[].name`
  - required display name
- `groups[].permissions[].description`
  - optional description

Authoring rules:

- define each permission id once in the bundle catalog
- use exact permission ids in `requires_permissions`
- permission ids, group ids, and names must be non-empty
- leading or trailing whitespace is rejected
- duplicate `group_id`, `permission_id`, or `requires_permissions` entries are rejected
- if a bundle includes more than one `*.permissions.yaml` file, loading fails

Runtime behavior:

- a skill with `requires_permissions` is hidden unless the caller has all listed permissions
- a tool with `requires_permissions` is unavailable unless the caller has all listed permissions
- profile permission assignment is validated against the active bundle slot's catalog
- if a profile is granted a permission id that is not defined in the active catalog, the update is rejected

## Runtime Prompt Manifest Shape

Runtime prompt manifests are bundle-scoped resources. They are not owned by a skill.

Flo loads at most one `*.prompts.yaml` file from a bundle. If more than one is present, bundle loading fails.

Required fields:

- `execution.preamble`

Optional fields:

- `system_prompt_resolver`

Example:

```yaml
execution:
  preamble: |
    You are a slot-scoped runtime.
    Keep responses concrete and concise.

system_prompt_resolver:
  script_file: prompts/resolve-system-prompt.mts
  entrypoint: resolveSystemPrompt
  timeout_ms: 3000
```

Field behavior:

- `execution.preamble`
  - required non-empty string
  - prepended to the runtime's configured execution-stage prompt
  - if the runtime execution prompt is empty, the preamble is used by itself
- `system_prompt_resolver`
  - optional dynamic session prompt script
  - `script_file` is resolved relative to the `*.prompts.yaml` file
  - `script_file` must be a relative `.mts` or `.mjs` path and cannot use `..`
  - `entrypoint` must name the exported resolver function
  - `timeout_ms` must be greater than zero
  - resolver failures fail the task with `system_prompt_resolution_failed`

The resolver receives the current `session_id` and sanitized profile fields:

```json
{
  "session_id": "wecom:group:chat-1:alice",
  "profile": {
    "profile_id": "profile-1",
    "profile_kind": "user",
    "permissions": ["returns.manage"],
    "display_name": "Alice"
  }
}
```

`display_name` is omitted when unavailable. The resolver may return a string, `null`,
or `undefined`. `null`, `undefined`, and blank strings mean no dynamic prompt. A
non-blank string is appended after the normal stage preamble for gate and execution
stages only; task-summary and context-summary prompts do not receive it.

Authoring rules:

- use this manifest for bundle-wide execution guidance that should apply regardless of which skills are selected
- keep it focused on durable execution behavior, not one-off task content
- unknown top-level fields are rejected
- resolver scripts are runtime prompt infrastructure, not user-visible tools

## Schedule Manifest Shape

Schedule manifests are bundle-scoped resources. They are not owned by a skill.

Required fields:

- `schedule_id`
- `profile_channel`
- `profile_external_user_id`
- `user_message`
- exactly one of `trigger` or `cron_expression`
- `timezone`

Optional fields:

- `context`
- `target_agent_override`
- `required_labels`
- `selected_skill_ids`
- `skip_skill_selection`
- `enabled`
- `concurrency_policy`
- `cron_expression`

Example:

```yaml
schedule_id: morning_digest
profile_channel: wecom
profile_external_user_id: alice
user_message: Send the morning digest.
selected_skill_ids:
  - skill.digest
trigger:
  kind: recurring
  times_of_day:
    - hour: 9
      minute: 0
timezone: America/Toronto
enabled: true
concurrency_policy: forbid
```

Behavior:

- Flo reconciles schedule manifests when a skill bundle is pushed and when `backend-service` starts with persisted bundle slots.
- Flo resolves `profile_channel` plus `profile_external_user_id` through the runtime alias table.
- If the alias does not exist, Flo auto-creates a normal non-admin user profile and records the alias.
- If a schedule manifest is removed, Flo deletes the managed schedule but does not delete the profile or alias it created.
- Managed schedules are read-only in the admin UI except for `Run now`.
- `concurrency_policy` defaults to `allow` for compatibility. Use `forbid` to skip a trigger while an earlier run is queued, blocked, running, or suspended.
- Succeeded, failed, and cancelled runs are terminal and do not prevent the next trigger.

For a non-overlapping five-minute email poller:

```yaml
schedule_id: email_analysis
profile_channel: wecom
profile_external_user_id: alice
user_message: Analyze new emails.
trigger:
  kind: recurring
  minutes_interval: 5
timezone: America/Toronto
concurrency_policy: forbid
```

If an earlier email-analysis run is still active at the next five-minute tick, Flo records the tick as triggered, skips dispatch, and advances the regular cadence. `Run now` applies the same policy but does not change the cadence when it is skipped.

## Schedule Trigger Shape

When using `trigger`, the supported shape is:

```yaml
trigger:
  kind: recurring
```

Recurring triggers support these fields:

- `minutes_interval`
  - optional integer in `1..=59`
  - runs every N minutes
- `hours_interval`
  - optional integer in `1..=23`
  - runs every N hours
- `times_of_day`
  - optional list of wall-clock times
  - each item has `hour` in `0..=23` and `minute` in `0..=59`
- `days_of_week`
  - optional list of weekdays using `0..=6`
  - `0` is Sunday, `6` is Saturday

Validation rules:

- define exactly one of `minutes_interval`, `hours_interval`, or `times_of_day`
- `days_of_week` is a filter and may be combined with any one of the cadence options above
- `times_of_day` entries must not contain duplicates
- in v1, all `times_of_day` entries must share the same `minute`
- `days_of_week` must not contain duplicates

Examples:

Every 15 minutes:

```yaml
trigger:
  kind: recurring
  minutes_interval: 15
```

Every 6 hours:

```yaml
trigger:
  kind: recurring
  hours_interval: 6
```

At 09:00 and 17:00 every weekday:

```yaml
trigger:
  kind: recurring
  times_of_day:
    - hour: 9
      minute: 0
    - hour: 17
      minute: 0
  days_of_week: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Use `cron_expression` instead of `trigger` when you need a schedule shape that is not covered by the recurring trigger fields.

## State and Vault Declarations

Use `state` when your script needs durable non-secret data:

```yaml
state:
  - name: session_counter
    key_prefix: counter.session.
    scope_kind: session
  - name: shared_counter
    key_prefix: counter.shared.
    scope_kind: shared
    scope_id: service
```

Use `vault` when your script needs secrets:

```yaml
vault:
  - key: api_token
    scope_kinds: [profile, shared]
```

The runtime still requires the script to fetch secrets explicitly through `flo.vault.get(...)`.

## Import Rules

The script runtime supports:

- local static ESM imports
- relative `.mjs`, `.mts`, and related local module paths

The runtime rejects:

- bare specifiers
- package-style imports
- dynamic `import()`
- `..` traversal for author-facing asset imports

### Scheduled suspension timeout

A schedule manifest can optionally cap how long each suspension lasts:

```yaml
concurrency_policy: forbid
suspension_timeout:
  seconds: 1800
  resume_prompt: "Finish with available information and report unresolved items."
```

The duration must be an integer from 1 to 31,536,000 seconds and the prompt must be
non-empty. A script may request a shorter wait. Suspended runs continue to count
as active for overlap prevention. A scheduled run receives one timeout-driven
resume; suspending again fails the run so later occurrences can proceed. This
setting does not limit active execution time. Changes apply to future runs.
